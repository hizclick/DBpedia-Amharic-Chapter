        The DBpedia Extraction Framework is an open-source tool used to extract structured information from Wikipedia. It converts the unstructured content of Wikipedia into RDF data, making it accessible for semantic web applications. This framework plays a crucial role in generating and maintaining the DBpedia knowledge base, which is widely used for research and data integration.
        
        The image below summrizes the the overall extraction framework.

        <h2 class="subtitle">Running the framework</h2>
        <!-- <h3 class="sub-section-title">Structure</h3>
        The framework is composed into different modules. We are particularly interested in the four moduels namely: <em class="highlight-language-keyword">core</em>,
        <em class="highlight-language-keyword">scripts</em>,
        <em class="highlight-language-keyword">dump</em>, and 
        <em class="highlight-language-keyword">server</em> -->
      
        <h3 class="sub-section-title">Extraction process</h3>
        <p>
            Running the extraction framework is a relatively complex task which is in details documented in the advanced QuickStart guide. To run the extraction process same as the DBpedia core team does, you can do using the MARVIN release bot. The MARVIN bot automates the overall extraction process, from downloading the ontology, mappings and Wikipedia dumps, to extraction and post-processing the data.

            Extraction generally could be of two types Generic and mapping based. Generic extracors use herustics to extract data while mapping based extractors uses manually curated mappings. you can view these mappings  here. 

            The extraction process generally involves parsing data and extracting information from wikipedia pages to make them available for query.

          In this query, ?s, ?p, and ?o represent the subject, predicate, and
          object of every triple in the dataset. When this query runs, it returns
          a list of all the triples, essentially giving you a snapshot of the
          entire dataset. It’s a powerful way to start exploring your data and
          understanding the structure of the information you're working with.
  
          <br />
          <br />
          In the following sections of this guideline, we will explain the basics
          of writing a SPARQL query. We will use a simple scenario of searching
          the DBpedia database for information about movies.

      <div class="paragraph">
        <h3 class="subsection-title">SELECT, WHERE and LIMIT</h3>
        <p>
          In SPARQL, the <em class="highlight-language-keyword">SELECT</em> clause
          is where you define the specific pieces of data you want to pull from
          your dataset. Think of it as telling the query exactly what information
          you're looking for and inorder to actually find the data you're
          interested in, you'll use the
          <em class="highlight-language-keyword">WHERE</em> clause. This is where
          you set the conditions, or patterns, that your data needs to match. It's
          like giving your query a set of instructions: "Find me movies, but only
          those that match these specific criteria." The following code snippet
          shows a query to retrieve a list of movies and their titles from DBpedia
          database.

        <p>
          In the above example, we are using the keyword
          <em class="highlight-language-keyword">SELECT</em> to specify which
          variables we want to retrieve the movie itself (?movie) and its title
          (?title).
  
          <br /><br />
          The keyword <em class="highlight-language-keyword">WHERE</em> is used to
          specify the conditions for matching data. Here, it specifies that:
  
          <mat-list>
            <mat-list-item
              ><p>
                1. `?movie` should be an instance of
                <a
                  href="https://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                  >http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film</a
                >, which is a DBpedia ontology class that represents a movie.
              </p></mat-list-item
            >
            <mat-list-item
              ><p>
                2. `?movie` should have a property called `foaf:name`, which holds
                the movie’s title.
              </p></mat-list-item
            >
          </mat-list>
  
          <em class="highlight-language-keyword">LIMIT</em> keyword is used to
          truncate the list of returned data and keep only the first 10 results.
          This is very handy when you are dealing with a large dataset but you are
          only interested in a sample pool. By setting a limit, you can easily
          achieve this.

          We can also retrieve additional properties, as long as those properties
          are present in the ontology class, by binding more variables. Below is a

          the name of each movie.

          Internationalized Resource Identifiers - IRIs
        </h3>
        <p>
          In SPARQL queries, URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and IRIs
          (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) are important for identifying
          resources and properties. They serve as unique identifiers that allow
          you to precisely specify the data you want to query. Each URL or IRI
          points to a specific resource or property within a dataset - DBpedia,
          for example, has its own set of resources and properties. Using IRIs
          eliminates confusion about what you’re querying and provides clear
          references that are understood universally.
  
          <br /><br />
          For instance, in our previous query example:
          <mat-list>
            <mat-list-item>
              <p>
                -> The URL
                <a
                  href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >
                  `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film`
                </a>
                identifies the Film class within the DBpedia ontology, specifying
                that we are interested in resources categorized as movies.
              </p>
            </mat-list-item>
  
            <mat-list-item>
              <p>
                -> The URL
                <a
                  href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                  >`http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name`</a
                >
                identifies the name property, which holds the title of each movie.
              </p>
            </mat-list-item>
          </mat-list>
        </p>
  
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            These URLs (or IRIs) are essential because they uniquely define what
            we mean by "Film" and "name" in the context of the DBpedia dataset.

      <div class="paragraph">
        <h3 class="subsection-title">Prefixes</h3>
        <p>
          As you start writing SPARQL queries, you’ll notice that many of the
          resources and properties have long, complex IRIs. Constantly typing out
          these lengthy IRIs can be cumbersome. That’s where prefixes come in.
  
          <br />
          <br />
          Prefixes are shorthand notations that allow you to reference long IRIs
          with shorter, more readable terms. By defining a prefix at the beginning
          of your SPARQL query, you create an alias for a specific IRI. This
          approach helps in making your queries cleaner and easier to read. To
          create a prefix, you need to identify the resource IRI that you will
          use. Specific properties from that IRI are referenced using the alias
          you define, so you only need to provide the part of the resource path
          after the prefix. The syntax is the keyword PREFIX, followed by an alias
          name, a colon, and the resource URL.

      <div class="paragraph">
        <h3 class="sub-section-title">Filters</h3>
        <p>
          In SPARQL queries, filters are used to refine and constrain the results
          based on specific conditions. They help in selecting only those data
          entries that meet certain criteria, narrowing down the dataset to only
          the most pertinent information. <br /><br />
          Use filters when you need to enforce specific conditions on your data,
          such as retrieving only movies released after a certain year or only
          movies with a runtime longer than a specific duration.
          <br /><br />
          Here’s an example of how you might use a FILTER in a SPARQL query to
          retrieve only movies released after 2000 and with a runtime of less than
          an hour and a half:

          It specifies the conditions for the data relationships and structure. On
