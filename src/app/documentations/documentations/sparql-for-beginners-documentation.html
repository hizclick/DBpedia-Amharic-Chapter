      <p>
        Before diving into the details of how to structure a SPARQL query, it’s
        important to understand the basics of how SPARQL works. At its core,
        SPARQL is all about querying data that’s structured in triples. A
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >triple</a
        >
        is the most fundamental unit of data in RDF (Resource Description
        Framework), and it consists of three parts: the subject, predicate, and
        object.

        <br /><br />You can think of triples like a simple sentence. The subject
        is what the sentence is about, the predicate is the characteristic or
        property of the subject, and the object is the value of that property.
        For example, in the triple &lt;Movie1&gt; &lt;hasTitle&gt; "Titanic",
        &lt;Movie1> is the subject, &lt;hasTitle&gt; is the predicate, and
        "Titanic" is the object. In SPARQL, variables are used to stand in for
        the parts of these triples that you're interested in.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3 class="sub-section-title">Variables</h3>
      Variables in SPARQL are denoted by a question mark (?) before the name,
      like ?movie, ?title, or ?releaseDate. These variables allow you to ask the
      database for any triples that match certain patterns. For instance, if you
      wanted to retrieve all triples in a dataset, you could write a simple
      query using variables for the subject, predicate, and object, like so:
    </div>

    <div class="code-snippet-container">
      <div class="code-snippet-header">
        
      </div>
      <pre><code class="language-sparql">
        SELECT ?s ?p ?o <br />
        WHERE &#123; <br />
        ?s ?p ?o . <br />
        &#125;
      </code>
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>
        In this query, ?s, ?p, and ?o represent the subject, predicate, and
        object of every triple in the dataset. When this query runs, it returns
        a list of all the triples, essentially giving you a snapshot of the
        entire dataset. It’s a powerful way to start exploring your data and
        understanding the structure of the information you're working with.

        <br />
        <br />
        In the following sections of this guideline, we will explain the basics
        of writing a SPARQL query. We will use a simple scenario of searching
        the DBpedia database for information about movies.

    <!-- SELECT, WHERE and LIMIT  -->
    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3 class="subsection-title">SELECT, WHERE and LIMIT</h3>
      <p>
        In SPARQL, the <em class="highlight-language-keyword">SELECT</em> clause
        is where you define the specific pieces of data you want to pull from
        your dataset. Think of it as telling the query exactly what information
        you're looking for and inorder to actually find the data you're
        interested in, you'll use the
        <em class="highlight-language-keyword">WHERE</em> clause. This is where
        you set the conditions, or patterns, that your data needs to match. It's
        like giving your query a set of instructions: "Find me movies, but only
        those that match these specific criteria." The following code snippet
        shows a query to retrieve a list of movies and their titles from DBpedia
        database.
        <br />
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="code-snippet-container">
      <div class="code-snippet-header">
        
      </div>
      <pre><code class="language-sparql">
        SELECT ?movie ?title <br />
        WHERE &#123;
         ?movie a &lt;http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film&gt; ;
        &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name&gt; ?title . 
         &#125;
        LIMIT 10
    </code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>
        In the above example, we are using the keyword
        <em class="highlight-language-keyword">SELECT</em> to specify which
        variables we want to retrieve the movie itself (?movie) and its title
        (?title).

        <br /><br />
        The keyword <em class="highlight-language-keyword">WHERE</em> is used to
        specify the conditions for matching data. Here, it specifies that:

        <mat-list>
          <mat-list-item
            ><p>
              1. `?movie` should be an instance of
              <a
                href="https://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film</a
              >, which is a DBpedia ontology class that represents a movie.
            </p></mat-list-item
          >
          <mat-list-item
            ><p>
              2. `?movie` should have a property called `foaf:name`, which holds
              the movie’s title.
            </p></mat-list-item
          >
        </mat-list>

        <em class="highlight-language-keyword">LIMIT</em> keyword is used to
        truncate the list of returned data and keep only the first 10 results.
        This is very handy when you are dealing with a large dataset but you are
        only interested in a sample pool. By setting a limit, you can easily
        achieve this.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>
        We can also retrieve additional properties, as long as those properties
        are present in the ontology class, by binding more variables. Below is a
        code snippet to retrieve the runtime and release date, in addition to
        the name of each movie.

    <!-- URL and IRIs -->
    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3 class="sub-section-title">
        Internationalized Resource Identifiers - IRIs
      </h3>
      <p>
        In SPARQL queries, URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and IRIs
        (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) are important for identifying
        resources and properties. They serve as unique identifiers that allow
        you to precisely specify the data you want to query. Each URL or IRI
        points to a specific resource or property within a dataset - DBpedia,
        for example, has its own set of resources and properties. Using IRIs
        eliminates confusion about what you’re querying and provides clear
        references that are understood universally.

        <br /><br />
        For instance, in our previous query example:
        <mat-list>
          <mat-list-item>
            <p>
              -> The URL
              <a
                href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >
                `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film`
              </a>
              identifies the Film class within the DBpedia ontology, specifying
              that we are interested in resources categorized as movies.
            </p>
          </mat-list-item>

          <mat-list-item>
            <p>
              -> The URL
              <a
                href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >`http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name`</a
              >
              identifies the name property, which holds the title of each movie.
            </p>
          </mat-list-item>
        </mat-list>
      </p>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
          These URLs (or IRIs) are essential because they uniquely define what
          we mean by "Film" and "name" in the context of the DBpedia dataset.

    <!-- Prefixes -->
    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Prefixes</h3>
      <p>
        As you start writing SPARQL queries, you’ll notice that many of the
        resources and properties have long, complex IRIs. Constantly typing out
        these lengthy IRIs can be cumbersome. That’s where prefixes come in.

        <br />
        <br />
        Prefixes are shorthand notations that allow you to reference long IRIs
        with shorter, more readable terms. By defining a prefix at the beginning
        of your SPARQL query, you create an alias for a specific IRI. This
        approach helps in making your queries cleaner and easier to read. To
        create a prefix, you need to identify the resource IRI that you will
        use. Specific properties from that IRI are referenced using the alias
        you define, so you only need to provide the part of the resource path
        after the prefix. The syntax is the keyword PREFIX, followed by an alias
        name, a colon, and the resource URL.
      </p>

          Now let’s take the previous example where we queried for the name,

          the query:

    <!-- Filter -->
    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3 class="sub-section-title">Filters</h3>
      <p>
        In SPARQL queries, filters are used to refine and constrain the results
        based on specific conditions. They help in selecting only those data
        entries that meet certain criteria, narrowing down the dataset to only
        the most pertinent information. <br /><br />
        Use filters when you need to enforce specific conditions on your data,
        such as retrieving only movies released after a certain year or only
        movies with a runtime longer than a specific duration.
        <br /><br />
        Here’s an example of how you might use a FILTER in a SPARQL query to
        retrieve only movies released after 2000 and with a runtime of less than
        an hour and a half:
